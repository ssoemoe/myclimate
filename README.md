# MyClimate #

MyClimate is an expected weather reminder android app which reminds(notifies) the user when his expected weather is coming and the user can plan ahead according to the weather reminder.

# Inspiration #

After a long cold winter, we expect a warm and cloudy weather conditions so that we can go dates enjoying the weather. However, when we use Google, Siri or other weather applications, they display weather data, but we have to scroll down all the way to see the weather before a week or two weeks. This is too much hassle for us and we want a notification or reminder when the weather we want is coming, and so we can plan ahead.  

# How It Works #

MyClimate has weather preferences settings which allow the user to choose his expected weather conditions and reminding periods such as before a day, a week, or a month. After setting the weather preferences, the app saves the user input and script the weather data to find the matched conditions according to the user's input. If the similar weather is found, the user will be notified before the time as he set in the preferences.
